I have been unable to continue playing Splinterlands for over an hour because I am stuck on the following screen:


![I'm stuck on this screen after unlocking the level](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/quigua/23tRzfVuB7xwnbkjZkAaJrYdeU9cb4k1v5cn87WDkdurLcXUKMoh6hQpUS2xEiUWLNEVu.png)


When I reached the rank of 1500 and went up to Gold I level, I was presented with the claim rewards screen. I claimed the rewards and then clicked on the items menu to proceed to combine the cards I had received. After that, every time I try to battle by clicking on the Play menu, the claim rewards screen appears again. It doesn't let me do anything other than see the rewards, but when I click on claim rewards again it informs me that I have already claimed them, as I actually did, but it returns to the same claim rewards screen again.

I have already deleted the cookies and browsing history but the situation remains the same. I can see all the game menus and navigate but in the case of the Play menu it shows me the claim or view rewards screen again.

I proceed to mention @yabapmat and @cryptomancer to see if it's something that needs to be fixed due to issues in today's update.
