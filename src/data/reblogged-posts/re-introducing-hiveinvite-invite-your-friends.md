After a wayyy too long period of neglect, being approached by several people at HiveFest made me speed up the process and fix https://hiveinvite.com, which now should be fully operational again.

## What is HiveInvite

Onboarding to Hive comes with a multitude of challenges, and one of the biggest issues is account creation. There are plenty of services out there, but they all rely on someone's account creation tokens to be available, and key security isn't perfect.

HiveInvite offers a fully featured solution for everyone to use the core Hive functionality of creating an account yourself, and doesn't reveal the keys to new accounts to anyone else but the new user.

### Claim account creation tokens

HiveInvite lets you claim your own account creation tokens in several ways. These tokens are not transferable, and can be used at any time to create a Hive account.

The current cost, defined by the witnesses, is 3 HIVE. This small amount of HIVE is necessary to prevent everyone from just creating all the account names they can think of and squatting the whole namespace. 
If you have staked a large amount of Hive Power, you can claim these tokens for free by spending a big amount of RC. This is possible with about 5000 HP, but the current number is very dynamic. For the whales out there it's possible to claim a maximum of 100 tokens at once.

### Create invites

The core functionality of HiveInvite is of course creating invites. 

There are 3 main ways to do this: 
- you can send out an email with customized text to the address of the person you want to invite
- you can create one or multiple invite links, which you can forward in any way you want
- you can create public invites that require the new users to introduce themselves to you, and optionally verify their socials. These invites are published on https://hiveinvite.com/public.html

Each of the options leads the new user to the second part of the app

### Accept invites

Anyone with an invite link can use it to request the creation of an account. They will be provided with a passphrase, used as master password to create their Hive keys. Each step explains the importance of the keys and how to handle them safely. After choosing their username, they will be forwarded to the hive.blog FAQ, to give them something to read while they have to wait for the creator of the invite to actually 

### Create the account

In this last step, the creator of the invite has to create the account on the blockchain, using their active key. Optionally some HP can be delegated right away. The account will be usable right after that.

### Internationalization

HiveInvite is meant to be used all over the world! It's been a long time since the initial translations were done, and a lot of the stuff is outdated. Check out the [GitHub](https://github.com/pharesim/hiveinvite) if you can help fixing one or two of the locales. English and german are up to date and can be used as templates.

### Closing note

I hope this tool is useful for you, please leave me a comment when you use it successfully!
