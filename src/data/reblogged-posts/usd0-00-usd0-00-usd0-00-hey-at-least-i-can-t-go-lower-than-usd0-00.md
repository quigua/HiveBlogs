Today, I thought, hey, I' gonna go do a whole bunch of research and write up a cool post, 
so I can be totally ignored by all but my favorite and most valued followers 
and make a great heaping pile of $0.00. 
$0.00, you say? Yeah, I could use some more $0.00. 
In fact I can never get enough $0.00. $0.00 makes my life complete. 
Then, I thought, nah, screw this I'm going to go learn today. 
This steemit thing isn't really improving my life. I've met a very few, very cool people but, 
it takes work to stay interesting. I can feel myself getting more boring, every minute I'm here.
My followers are soon going to start eyeing that unfollow button, 
thinking, there's got to be something less boring than this. 
To the whales, your idea of value is pretty thin. I defended you when I first got here. 
I was thinking that you had earned your advantage but, 
that's not what i see on the trending page.
Occasionally I'll see something useful, like corbettreport but,
mostly It's looking like it's just a time sink. 
I don't know what the big money voters think is value but, 
they might want to look that word up. 
One look at the trending page and all I see is steemit promotion, 
people's personal fantasies, and fly on a leaf photography. 
I do wish that I could hang out with the followers who I share interests with. 
I don't relish the term "follower". 
These are my steemit core, my support, the reason I come back here. 
Maybe someday, we'll all get together and have a very valuable time. 
So, until at least tomorrow, I've had about as much $0.00 as I can handle.
To my Core, maybe I'll be more interesting tomorrow. Thank you for all that you do.
