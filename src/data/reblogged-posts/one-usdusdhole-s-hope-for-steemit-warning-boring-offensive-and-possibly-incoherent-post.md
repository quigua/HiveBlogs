Hello fellow...steemiters?  Do we have an official word for that yet?  Steemiters is one of the most unnatural words I've ever tried to say.

So Steemit's been cool so far!  Especially if you're easily tempted to learn about random stuff because of some undiagnosed form of ADD.  The community's great too, lots of like-minded people here, and almost everyone's been really nice.  TOO nice.  Yea, so while I'm kidding, I do actually believe that a healthy injection of genuine assholery would be good not only for those very deserving individuals, but would reinvigorate long-lost and much-needed elements that contribute to a well-informed and self-reliant community of truly free and independent individuals.  That's pretty much a pipe dream now; definitely not expecting it in my lifetime.

I dunno if this could be related, but I'm also noticing a lack of critical posts, even when explicitly asked for!  And yea, I'm guilty of it too--and it's not just because of the smug pleasure derived from the moral masturbation of mindlessly ejaculating praises to the unworthy.  Most of the time, I'm too lazy and apathetic to even bother to offer a critical suggestion or point out a correction, let alone sit up to think of the best way to convince someone of the truth while prioritizing their humiliation and spanking of their ego.  But I realize that my inaction IS the ACTUAL shittiness that's contributing to everything I'm whining about.  And I honestly have difficulty in disproving the...contrapositive?

contrapositive - negate both the hypothesis and conclusion, then switch them; the contrapositive of any true statement is also true.  HA!  take that, sexy LSAT instructor...

avoid being an asshole -> you're actually just being shitty 
                                  =
if you don't wanna be shitty -> be an asshole

We're all adults here.  And we're all basically anonymous to each other.  AND we grew up with the internet.  So what in the actual hell happened to people to make them so...intolerant to criticism?  completely unable to logically and verbally defend themselves or their ideas??  It's  still amazing to have witnessed this absolute 180.  I remember being a, and being surrounded by, disturbingly vicious kids at school.  We wouldn't have given even one fuck about making a homeless, terminally-ill orphan shit herself from crying too much.

Okay, 99% of the time, there's certainly no need to go that far (unless you're really bored or in a particularly playful mood).  But people should embrace the blessings that online social networks of anonymity provide.  Not only are these forums facilitating the expression of real, very real, honesty (if desired), but they even provide actual people to direct that honesty at, in complete safety while being relatively free of consequences.  And for the people that can't take it?  Everytime an asshole confronts them, they get one step closer to experiencing the real world. Win-win-win.  

Another aspect of this that's bugged me enough to actually sit down and write, is specific to steemit.  So I haven't been convinced either way yet of what the intentions of the leaders of, and other influential people involved with, Steemit are.  And I don't even have a guess as to Steemit's chances of reaching the potential that I think it could have (or at least some platform of a similar concept..)  Basically, the feature I'm most interested in, and the same goes for cryptocurrencies/blockchain technology in general, is the concept of "trustless" systems.  

So it's a huge deal that Bitcoin could be the answer to the endlessly rampant corruption in the financial industry at all levels.  I used to wonder why we didn't craft legislation with the assumption that corruption is a political constant in the real world...until I realized how stupid and naive it was.  Then I turned 10.  Which is also why I get uncontrollably violent thoughts during any interaction with what seems to be a recent revival of mindless socialist supporters (Neo-Marxist?).  It's even more stupefying when you learn that many of these people's political preferences are influenced by their disapproval of the exploitation borne by inequalitiy in the distribution of  power.  Because obviously the answer is to give the MORE power to the source of inequality (referring to the government monopoly on violence) so that they can make things more fair, because we can trust them this time?  Anyway, off topic.

The point I was supposed to make is, what Bitcoin and cryptos are to the hope of  a fair financial playing field for everyone, Steemit and similar platforms could be for free speech (in the most ideal, loftiest, libertarian's wet dream, version).  Instead of trusting one of our most important freedoms to some compromised institution or psychopathic politician, we can avoid the inevitable disappointment, and instead, the people themselves can take on the responsibility and safeguard their freedoms (probably much more effectively than a politician, since they have the most incentive).  

But the foundation has to be truth and honesty, or really, what's the point if we end up policing and censoring ourselves?  And that in itself is just as pointless.  No matter how much policing and censoring is forced on the citizenry in the name of political correctness, or preventing triggers, or whatever fucking bullshit the current global ruling elite have managed to get society's lowest common denominator to parrot, people will still get their feelings hurt, feel threatened, and--for the mentally unstable flavor of stupid and self-centered--get provoked into being the patsy for the next government-sponsored (tax-funded!) false flag.

Maybe there's some validity to the idea that we've (Americans) luckily gone so long without actually having our freedoms threatened (HAH I meant by external sources obviously), that we are completely unable to assess it's value accurately.  Alright, anyway, I'm getting tired and feel like a ranty, ramblinh, annoying grandpa.  So I'll finish by commending the  brave few that are willing to bear social stings of flagging and risk alienating strangers they will never meet in real life.  These altruistic assholes are heroes that intimately understand the costs and values of truth, freedom, and independence, that most Americans have eagerly traded away for modern-day trinkets.   And so I  urge you all to try and speak with your inner asshole.
