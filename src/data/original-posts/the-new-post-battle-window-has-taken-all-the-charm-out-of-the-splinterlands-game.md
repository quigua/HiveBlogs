Splinterlands has just updated the post-battle screen with a new format. I can't say I like it or dislike it; rather, I have a fairly neutral feeling about this change. I assume these kinds of changes are made to make backend work more efficient. However, there are some things that have started to bother me, and the main one is the feeling of being stuck in a kind of loop during battles.

My usual routine when playing Splinterlands consists of analyzing the battle results. The first thing I do is check my ranking after the battle. Damn! Where's the ranking? It's gone, it just disappeared. The next thing I looked at was who my opponent was to see if I was fighting a bot or a human (yes, in Modern, there are still bots that annoy me), but no! It disappeared too. In fact, for some strange reason, I always went to look at the history of my opponents' last battles and see their cards. Yes, I take it very easy when playing Splinterlands! But now I'm a little annoyed with the new screen because I have to go back to the Lobby first to see or remember who my opponent was and maintain my game routine. Yes, it's old school stuff where resistance to change doesn't allow me to adapt quickly. In fact, in the end it's still the same routine and instead of closing the battle screen as it was done before, now I simply return to the Lobby, and from there, once I see the information again, which is my reward and which is very important for my dopamine, then I hit the battle button again and get back to work.

It seems silly, but not having the feeling of being in a pointless loop frees me from that feeling of suffocation I started to feel after a few battles.

As I said at the beginning, my feelings about the new post-battle screen are pretty neutral, but after being stuck in the loop for a few battles, it no longer feels the same, and it simply ends up generating a certain feeling of anxiety that screams "Get out of there!"

Suggestions: Include basic information like the final ranking of the player and their opponent, and how much CP my opponent had available. I would like to be able to analyze their battle and card history. In short, I personally like to know if my opponent beat me because they're a better player than me or because they were, as I mentally call them, a super-gifted idiot with too many legendaries.

In conclusion, in my very personal opinion, the new post-battle window has taken all the charm out of the game, and now it seems like the only thing that matters is how much you've won in battle. I understand that for Splinterlands, highlighting the fact that you make money has always been its fundamental focus, but they also shouldn't forget that there are people who don't give a damn whether they make money or not and simply play the game for fun.
