This is the second time I have found myself in a battle with the "stampede trample" rule in which using a card with a melee attack this ability does not activate after defeating the enemy unit. 
In this specific case the combination of rules were "Beefcakes", "Hive fives" and "Stampede Trample". The link to the battle is [this](https://splinterlands.com/battle/sl_e5ddec31993c37ecdc19b6d9b3fae269?ref=quigua).

It is very likely that if this ability had been activated, the outcome of the battle would have been very different.
